# React + Vite

### This is a React application which uses the foundational concepts of React like event listeners, using fetch inside async await to get data from an API, using useState and useEffect hooks, etc. [Click here](https://aayushthakur1999.github.io/meme-generator/) to view the project live.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
